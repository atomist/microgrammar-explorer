atomist parser gui
===========================

the objective is to display, interactively, the tree parsed from various code by Atomist's [microgrammar](https://github.com/atomist/microgrammar) library.

clone, then 'npm install' and 'npm run build' and 'npm run start' -- it should tell you what port to hit.
